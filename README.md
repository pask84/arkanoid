Simple implementation of the classic arcade game Arkanoid. 

The game features a paddle controlled by the user and a ball that bounces off the paddle and bricks. The objective of the game is to break as many bricks as possible without letting the ball hit the bottom edge of the screen. 

The code uses the HTML canvas for rendering the game and plain JavaScript for the game logic. The game has features like collision detection, game over condition, and score tracking. The main game loop is handled by the `gameLoop()` function, which updates the game state and re-renders the game at a set interval.

The code is well-structured and divided into multiple JavaScript files, each responsible for a specific part of the game, making it easier to understand and maintain. It's a great example of how to create a simple yet fun game using just JavaScript and HTML canvas.
